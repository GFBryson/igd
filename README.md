# Introduction to Game Development - CSC205 - Fall'17

## Course Objectives And Learning Outcomes

The course introduces the development fundamentals of Video Games, and other interactive applications. The core of the course is devoted to the presentation of technologies (algorithms, data structures, techniques) most commonly adopted by modern 2D/3D video games. We will first introduce core concepts from Computer Graphics such as vectors and transformations, parametric and implicit representations (lines, circles), and rasterization. We then discuss how to organize the scene objects within a scene graph, how to discretize physics to represent object motion and collisions, and introduce particle systems. We will present the use of artificial intelligence for the creation of automatic game behavior, and the use of spatial sound. We will discuss textured meshes to represent 2D/3D geometry, and techniques for mesh animations like skinning and blendshapes. The final part of the course will cover the fundamentals of sampling and aliasing, and techniques for image compression and filtering. The lectures will cover the theory, while labs and homeworks review these concepts with practical experience in Unity/C#.
