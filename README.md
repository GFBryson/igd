# Introduction to Game Development - CSC205 - Fall'17

## Course Objectives And Learning Outcomes

The course introduces the development fundamentals of Video Games, and other interactive applications. The core of the course is devoted to the presentation of technologies (algorithms, data structures, techniques) most commonly adopted by modern 2D/3D video games. We will first introduce core concepts from graphics such as vectors and transformations, parametric and implicit representations (lines, circles), and rasterization. We then discuss how to organize the scene objects within a scene graph, how to discretize physics to represent object motion and collisions, and introduce particle systems. We will present the use of artificial intelligence for the creation of automatic game behavior, and the use of spatial sound. We will discuss textured meshes to represent 2D/3D geometry, and techniques for mesh animations like skinning and blendshapes. The final part of the course will cover the fundamentals of sampling and aliasing, and techniques for image compression and filtering. The lectures will cover the theory, while labs and homeworks review these concepts with practical experience in C# within the Unity game engine.

* Lab, homeworks and projects are to be in *C#* and *Unity*
* This course includes 3 programming-based assignments (note hw3 is a group project)
* Your assignments should **not be publicly posted** (on github, bickbucket, etc..), please use private repositories
* Code and ideas obtained from elsewhere and used as part of an assignment must be documented in the README.md
* You can get unlimited private repositories by subscribing to the [Student Developer Pack](http://education.github.com)
* For courses which have final exams, students are strongly advised not to make final plans for travel or employment during the exam period since special arrangements will not be made for examinations that may conflict with such plans.
